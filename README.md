# Lampe2

Project to control your raspberry-pi-zero-w unicornhathd lamp with your android phone.
This is the Android part.

Current minSdkVersion 14, so it should work for Android 4.0 upwards, though I only tested it on Android 7.1

Project compiles with Android Studio 3.3.2. Might work with other versions too, but that is the one I used.

# Installation

See this [instructable](https://www.instructables.com/id/Bluetooth-Lamp-Android-Raspberrypi-Unicornhathd/) for details.

# Base

I used [this](http://it-in-der-hosentasche.blogspot.com/2014/03/bluetooth-zwischen-raspberry-pi-und.html) tutorial for the bluetooth communication.

# Note:

You should follow the instructions on the [raspberry part](https://github.com/Pardoxa/lamp2) first.

If you did, you are now paired with the raspberry.

Use Android studio to install the app and have fun :)

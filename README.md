# Lampe2

Project to control your raspberry-pi-zero-w unicornhathd lamp with your android phone.
This is the Android part.

Current minSdkVersion 14, so it should work for Android 4.0 upwards, though I only tested it on Android 7.1

Project compiles with Android Studio 3.3.1. Might work with other versions too, but that is the one I used.
